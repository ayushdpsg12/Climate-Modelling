# Climate Change Prediction with SARIMA Model

This project aims to predict climate change trends using the SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model. 
The code leverages real-world data on temperature, greenhouse gases, and ocean surface temperature to make predictions about future temperature changes.

## Getting Started

To run the code, you'll need Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels scikit-learn
